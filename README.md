# Overview

In my pursuit of continuous learning as a software engineer, I have developed a software project with the aim of enhancing my skills and knowledge. The software I've created serves as a practical application of what I've learned and showcases my ability to build a functional system.

## Description

I developed an online book store by utilizing a tech stack that includes JavaScript, React, AWS Amplify, DynamoDB, and S3. This software serves as a comprehensive digital platform designed to offer a seamless and user-friendly experience for both book enthusiasts and potential buyers.

## Purpose

The primary purpose behind creating this software is to establish a user-centric and efficient online marketplace for books. Through this platform, users can browse an extensive catalog of books, access detailed information about each title, and make purchases as per their preferences.
